                <h5>Bonnie Greer</h5>
                <p>Bonnie Greer, OBE is an American-British playwright, novelist, critic and broadcaster, who has lived
                    in the UK since 1986. She has appeared as a panellist on television programmes such as Newsnight
                    Review and Question Time and has served on the boards of several leading arts organisations,
                    including the British Museum, the Royal Opera House, and the London Film School. She is Vice
                    President of the Shaw Society, and the former Chancellor of Kingston University in Kingston upon
                    Thames, London.</p>
                <p>Bonnie Greer returned to the museum late 2019, by invitation of the Director, Hartwig Fischer, to
                    create and work with him on a project called "Era of Reclamation" which much of the works she is
                    doing with the British Museum will be concerned with the history of African people and people of
                    African descent around the world. Hartwig Fisher was mutually impressed about OHF Vision. Bonnie's
                    quote "A museum dedicated to the achievements of Nigerian women, past and present; a museum
                    dedicated to African women past and present; a museum dedicated to all women past and present: all
                    of these goals and more located in one museum, is an idea that I want to be a part of."</p>
