                As a specialized facility, Museum of Black Women In History (MoBWIH), to be established in Oyo town, Oyo
                State, Nigeria, is a project of Oranyan Heritage Foundation (OHF).


                The founder of OHF, Chief Mrs Comfort Titilayo Orija-Adesoye who is also the Iya-Laje of Oyo, has, in
                collaboration with art and culture experts, researched the Nigerian culture space and saw a vacuum. OHF
                and
                a Lagos-based management/consulting firm, Lumin-Artica, realised that there was no museum in Nigeria
                (none
                till date) with specialized focus on the history of black women.
            </p>
            <img src="static/images/Museo-BWIH-double-front (1).png" class="mobwih-museum-logo">

            <p>
                The concept of the proposed-MoBWIH is to create a single space where great women of black descents,
                mostly
                from the ancient, modern past and across the world will be documented in pictorial and literary
                contents.
                The collections of the pictorial and literary contents are thrown to Open Call for historians and
                artists.
                The collections will be on display inside various gallery spaces of MoBWIH.

                The contents of the museum will start with great women of Nigerian descents whose roles had imparted
                their
                individual environments. The coverage of MoBWIH include all professions that great women of black
                descents
                have been involved in the past.
                However, black women of contemporary and subsisting periods are not excluded in the contents of MoBWIH.
                The
                diversity of the contents, expectedly will enrich the different galleries.


                The founder, Chief Mrs Orija-Adesoye, Lumin-Artica and OHF wish to state categorically that the Museum
                of
                Black Women In History (MoBWIH) is a concept exclusive to Oranyan Heritage Foundation in Nigeria,
                perhaps,
                across Africa and beyond.

            </p>

                The Museum of Black Women In History is a project with inputs from Bonnie Greer, a former Board of
                Trustee
                member, British Museum. Greer is working with Hartwig Fischer the current Director of British Museum on
                the
                Era of Reclamation which Lanre Olagoke also is involved as an artist working with over 25 youths in the
                UK
                under the charity Art-Alive Arts Trust, charity that works with youth that are underprivileged, homeless
                and
                unemployed.
