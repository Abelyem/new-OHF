                    <p>Chief (Mrs) Comfort Titilayo Adesoye-Orija, the Iya-Laje of Oyo.

                        Born in Lagos on March 18, 1939, as the first child of a famous family of Late Mr. Edward
                        Omolaja
                        Orija (father) and Late Julianah Omolara Orija (mother), the founder of OHF is also a first
                        grandchild of Papa Samuel Bamigboye Orija. Her Father was from Abeokuta, whilst her mother (nee
                        Adeyemi John) had Oyo ancestry.

                        She was tutored by her aunt, a renowned teacher, the Late Mrs. Aina David, under whom she had
                        her
                        childhood (along with many other known personalities, including His Imperial Majest,y Oba Lamidi
                        Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, and Late Lanre John), who all lived with Late Sir Kofoworola
                        Abayomi,
                        her mother's uncle.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Chief (Mrs) Adesoye-Orija attended Ireti Primary School, Breadfruit, Lagos, as well as Yaba
                        Methodist School and Abeokuta Girls' School. In 1959, she went to London to continue her
                        education
                        at Balham and Tooting College for the Distributive Trade to study Trade Art and Design.

                        She worked for John Lewis Partnership where she was the First Black African at that time to work
                        with the company considering the high level then of racial discrimination in London. She
                        returned to
                        Nigeria in 1964 and joined A. G. Leventis, Marina, Lagos for a short spell before she proceeded
                        into
                        entrepreneurship wholesale (Hayes Head-ties).
                    </p>









                    <p>In 1984, Chief (Mrs) Adesoye-Orija returned to London to care for her seven children, who, to the
                        glory of God, today, are respectively doing well. She continued her hospitality business by
                        being
                        pacesetter in the marketing of African Take-Away Dishes in London Her pioneering effort then
                        has,
                        today, generated quite a lot African restaurants.in London.

                        In 1990, she was inspired to form an NGO named 'OVER 50s WEST AFRICAN WOMEN FORUM", which she
                        modified into a "62 WOMEN STRONG WEST AFRICAN WOMEN ASSOCIATION" (NAOWA) with six other women
                        from
                        Gambia, Namibia, Ghana and Nigeria. This strategic platform, formed about 5 years ago, is aimed
                        at
                        bringing about speedy socio-economic development to the Yoruba ancestral states of Oyo, Ogun,
                        Ondo,
                        Ekiti, Osun and Lagos in Nigeria as well as globally, beyond the African continent.
                    </p>

                    <p>As the Iya-Laje of Oyo, Chief (Mrs) Orija-Adesoye, in 2015, founded Oranyan Heritage Foundation
                        (OHF) as a major vehicle to drive the socio-cultural and economic responsibilities of her
                        office.
                        Traditionally, the office of Iya-Laje empowers her to lead the community through economic
                        prowess.
                        But Chief Mrs Orija-Adesoye, being from a rich cultural heritage is using the OHF in a broader
                        format to touch nearly all aspects of develments, starting with the Museum of Black Women in
                        History
                        (MoBWIH).

                        Recently, she was appointed tas he Chairperson of OHF in partnership with Lumin-Artica, a
                        consulting
                        firm, which will oversee the structuring of the Museum of Black Women In History. OHF is a
                        Non-Governmental Organisation, with the main objective of promoting and making the people of Oyo
                        aware of the good work that His Imperial Majesty Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, Alaafin of Oyo, is
                        doing in
                        Yorubaland, for the Yoruba and to leave a good legacy for the younger ones. â€œMy vision is to
                        build a
                        Museum for Black Women all over the world, celebrate their achievements from the past and
                        present
                        and the legacy will carry on from generation to generation." the OHF founder stated.
                    </p>
                    <p>Advanced age of the OHF founder notwithstanding, she loves appearing resplendently as she
                        believes
                        in the Yoruba proverbs, which say 'Osise kI nrin bi ole (A hardworking person should not live
                        like a
                        lazy one). 'Mo ti d'agba mi o s'oge mo, ko si owo lo nje be'. (I am elderly to be a fashionista
                        is
                        simply an expression of lack).
                        The OHF founder remains a very active member of the British Labour Party, but enjoys her private
                        life, cherishes her business, and proudly a business consultant. She is full of fulfilment and
                        will
                        continue to thank God.</p>
