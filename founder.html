                <p>Chief (Mrs) Comfort Titilola Adesoye Orija, Iya Laje of Oyo Empire.
                    Born in Lagos on March 18th 1939 as the first
                    child of the famous family of Late Mr. Edward
                    Omolaja Orija (father) and Late Julianah
                    Omolara Orija (mother) and first grandchild
                    of Papa Samuel Bamigboye Orija. Her Father
                    was from Abeokuta, whilst her mother (nee
                    Adeyemi John) was from Oyo.
                </p>

                <p>She was tutored by her aunt, a renowned
                    teacher, the Late Mrs. Aina David, under
                    whom she grew (along with personages
                    including His Imperial Majesty Oba Lamidi
                    Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, and Late Lanre
                    John), who all lived with Late Sir Kofoworola
                    Abayomi, her mother's uncle.
                </p>

                <p>She attended Ireti Primary School,
                    Breadfruit, Lagos as well as Yaba Methodist
                    School and Abeokuta Girls' School. In 1959
                    she went to London to continue her
                    education at Balham and Tooting College for
                    the Distributive Trade to study Trade Art and
                    Design.
                </p>

                <p>She worked for John Lewis
                    Partnership where she was the First Black
                    African at that time to work with the company considering the high level then of racial
                    discrimination in London. She
                    returned to Nigeria in 1964 and joined A. G. Leventis, Marina, Lagos for a short spell before she
                    proceeded to go into entrepreneurship wholesale (Hayes Head-ties).
                </p>

                <p>In 1984, she returned to London to care for her seven children who to the glory of God today are
                    respectively doing well. She continued her hospitality business by being the
                    Pace-Setter in the marketing of African Take Away Dishes in London, which today is awash with
                    African restaurants.
                </p>

                <p>In 1990, she was inspired to form an NGO named 'OVER 50s WEST AFRICAN WOMEN FORUM" which she modified
                    into a "62 WOMEN STRONG WEST AFRICAN WOMEN
                    ASSOCIATION" (NAOWA) with six other women from Gambia, Namibia, Ghana and Nigeria. This strategic
                    platform formed about 5 years ago is aimed at bringing about speedy socio-economic development to
                    the global Yoruba Ancestral State of Oyo, Ogun,
                    Ondo, Ekiti, Osun and Lagos Nigeria and beyond the African continent.
                </p>

                <p>As the Iya-Laje of Oyo, Chief Mrs Comfort Titilayo Orija Adesoye, in 2015 founded Oranyan Heritage
                    Foundation (OHF) as a major vehicle to drive the socio-cultural and economic responsibilities of her
                    office. Traditionally, the office of Iya-Loja empowers her to lead the community through economic
                    prowess. But Chief Mrs Orija-Adesoye, being from a rich cultural heritage is using the OHF in a
                    broader format to touch nearly all aspects of develments, starting with the Museum of Black Women in
                    History (MoBWIH).</p>

                <p>Recently, she was appointed the Chairperson of her newly formed NGO named Oranyan Heritage Foundation
                    (OHF) in partnership with Lumin-Artica, a consulting firm whom will oversee the structuring of the
                    Museum of Black Women In History.
                    OHF is a Non-Governmental Organisation, with the main objective of promoting and making the people
                    of Oyo aware of the good work that His Imperial Majesty Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, Alaafin of Oyo, is doing
                    in Yoruba land, for the Yoruba and to leave a good legacy for the younger ones. â€œMy vision is to
                    build a Museum for Black Women all over the world, to celebrate their achievements from the past and
                    present and that the legacy will carry on from generation to generation
                </p>

                <p>God loves hard work and so she likes to work hard always. She is caring, but strongly believes in
                    discipline. Her age notwithstanding, she loves appearing resplendently, she
                    believes in the Yoruba proverbs which says "Sise sise ko gbodo ribi ole", "Mo ti d'agba mio s'oge
                    mo, ko si owo lo nje be". ("A hardworking person cannot live like a lazy one", "I am
                    too old for fashion is simply an expression of poverty"). She remains a very active
                    member of the British Labour Party, she enjoys her private life, cherishes her business,
                    and proud to be a business consultant. She is full of fulfilment and will continue to thank
                    God.
